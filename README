TheREADMEfile should include your name, a short description of your project,
and any other comments you think are relevant to the grading. It should
have two clearly labeled sections titled with KNOWN PROBLEMS, and DESIGN. The KNOWN PROBLEMS section should include a specific description
of all known problems or program limitations. This will not hurt your grade,
and may (in rare cases) improve it. I am more sympathetic when students
have thoroughly tested their code and clearly understand their shortcomings, and less so when I find bugs that students are ignorant of or have tried
to hide. You should also include references to any materials that you referred
to while working on the project. Please do not include special instructions
for compilation. The compilation and running of the tests will be automated
(see details below) and your instructions will not be followed.

Project 1

Part 1 of this project is a memory leak detector built using a shim. Part 2 is a system call tracer.

KNOWN ISSUES
1. Integer to pointer conversion issues in leakcount.c when using execv. As of 9/24 at 4:40PM I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Will attempt to fix before Tuesday, though.
